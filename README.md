# Language-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes-in-Python
## Classified sentences into one of Slovak, Czech, and English. Implemented relevant preprocessing steps, addressed the class imbalance in training set by employing the learned theory of Naive Bayes Models, and implementing subword units.

* Explored and visualized dataset to identify key issues in training data
* Preprocessed and cleaned dataset using relevant methods
* Explored theory of Naive Bayes Modeling, and trained first model
* Developed approach using learned theory to improve performance
* Designed new approach using subwords to mitigate class imbalance problems
